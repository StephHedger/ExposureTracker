# ExposureTracker
Right now, a valuable piece of information we could add to the epidemiological knowledge body is who has been in contact with whom. If we create an app that people can install on their phones that reports their locations to a graph database we can build a picture of transmission paths. Once we have that information it would be a simple matter to alert app users if they've potentially been exposed and allow us to share information and learning's with medical professionals.
